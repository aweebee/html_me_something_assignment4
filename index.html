<h3>&quot;I Think it's Time for You to Go Now&quot;</h3>
<h4>by Andrea Kimberling</h4>

<p>That summer, months after Deb's brother found their mother dead, was when Deb realized she'd made a mistake. She lived too close. It was just too easy to drive by whenever she wanted to, and driving by meant she might be seen by her brother who still lived at home, and then she'd have to go inside and find something--anything--to talk about. Anything but death. Soon as a parent gets sick, everyone around you becomes an expert. They won't be around forever, you know. You'll regret it if you don't make things right. Family is all you've got.</p>

<p>All the you-should-come-back-here's had been enough to make her uproot the life she'd created abroad with her interesting Dutch husband in their interesting little town in the South of Holland. She'd felt like a hero then, moving all the way back home to the suburbs of St. Louis. She was a changed woman, an international woman, a homeowner, a tourguide (not that there was much to show her husband in St. Louis). That initial move away from her hometown empowered her--no one ever seemed to get out of St. Louis alive. But she did. She'd made it out, and now she was returning--returning to a life she never thought she'd go back to, and now that she was staring it in the face she had to find something to say.</p>

<p>But Deb liked socializing as a means to an end, and only when she'd have something interesting to contribute--otherwise, what was the point? She never liked the phone much, but even months after her mother's funeral, she found herself making phone calls all the time. Mostly the old landline (thankfully it hadn't been disconnected, thankfully Andy never really answered that phone anyway). She'd hang up before the beep: Hi, you have reached Norma and Marshall. We can't come to the phone right now. Please leave your name and number and we'll get back with you as soon as possible. Thank you, bye-bye.</p>

<p>&quot;Deb?&quot;</p>

<p>She nearly dropped her phone in the sink. &quot;Kitchen!&quot; she shouted, setting her phone face-down on the counter, far from the splash zone. Her heart flew out of her chest.</p>

<p>Boede's boots clunked heavily down the stairs. He entered the kitchen holding an open tri-folded paper in his hands, glasses slumped down to the tip of his nose.</p>

<p>&quot;How'd we get behind on this?&quot; he asked, brows scrunched together.</p>

<p>&quot;Must be processing still,&quot; she said, and scrubbed a plate with particular vigor. &quot;I mailed the check in a week ago.&quot; She'd been saying this now for weeks, but he hadn't realized it yet.</p>

<p>He grunted. &quot;Do I need a part-time job? Start dancing on the weekends?&quot; His jokes used to endear him to her, but now she found herself cringing more often. Besides, no one ever wanted to help you without the expectation that you'd do something for them. That was just the way with people. Letdowns only ever accompanied love, family, companionship, affection--all the best things in life worth having. Sometimes she wondered if she was destined to be alone.</p>

<p>She smiled flatly, hand on her hip. &quot;Just do the dishes when it's your turn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Looks like you have finished already,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Get Lizzie's dishes from her room,&quot; she said. &quot;Yes, she knows not to, but I know better.&quot; Deb's shirt clung to her rounded belly like a goofy smile, mocking the weight she couldn't seem to lose. &quot;And grab any you left in your study,&quot; she said, wiping her eyes, drying her hands on her shirt.</p>

<p>&quot;And the mortgage? I am taking care of this as well?&quot; he said. &quot;Don't want to get behind on that, too.&quot; That adorable lilt in his voice was gone, replaced by a shrewd teacher-voice. She'd heard him use it on Lizzie.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm handling it,&quot; she said, snatching the envelope from him. Her soapy hands made the paper stick to her fingers. &quot;Please, just give me that much. Or else I'll really, really lose it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What now?&quot; he said. &quot;Come here.&quot; He tried to pull her into a hug.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm covered in dishwater,&quot; she said, &quot;and sweat.&quot; She pulled away.</p>

<p>&quot;That might be okay,&quot; he said. &quot;Every once in a while.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; she said, throwing the dish towel on the counter. &quot;I'll get all the dishes myself.&quot;</p>

<p>After she put Lizzie to sleep, Deb sat in the dark at the kitchen table. When she opened her laptop the kitchen glowed a shrewd white. She made sure all of the accounts, going forward, were marked--paperless.</p>
